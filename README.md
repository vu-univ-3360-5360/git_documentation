This repository contains introductory documentation for major concepts 
of reproducible research and the git revision control tools that we will use in 
this course.

* You should start with [Reproducible_research](Reproducible_research.pdf),
  which introduces the important concepts of reproducible research, which we
  will be using in this lab section.

* Then, you should read about revision control in [Git_intro](Git_intro.pdf).

* Before Tuesday, install Git Kraken on your computer and sign up for a free 
  student account on [github.com](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new).
  If you have any trouble getting the student account, you can sign up for a regular
  free account at <https://github.com> and then request an upgrade to a student
  account.
