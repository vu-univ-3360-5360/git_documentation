This repository contains introductory documentation for major concepts
of reproducible research and the git revision control tools that we will use in
this course.

* You should start with [Reproducible_research](Reproducible_research.pdf),
  which introduces the important concepts of reproducible research, which we
  will be using in this lab section.

* Then, you should read about revision control in [Git_intro](Git_intro.pdf).

* Before Tuesday, you should:
  * Install Git Kraken from <https://www.gitkraken.com> (get the free version) 
  * Sign up for a free student account at <https://github.com>
    * Then request a student discount at
      <https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new>
      (tell them you want a discount for your individual account, using your
      `vanderbilt.edu` email address), and
    * Request your "free student software pack" at
      <https://education.github.com/pack>
